Creative Mode gives you an unlimited ability to build anything, high-resolution detail blocks, extensive world editing tools, schematics, blueprints and copy-paste systems. It does not feature most of the survival elements, and should not be thought of as a 'cheat mode' for Survival!
This is an existing Creative world, but, sadly, I don't have cool stats to really show you here. Would you like a picture of a cat instead?

Default settings are set to be super-fast and super-easy for new players! If you want it even FASTER, choose Eternal Day for Day/Night Cycle. If you want more of a challenge, then fiddle with these settings to your heart's content!
 Remember these settings are LOCKED for the duration of your world and take note of the par times!
You've been in this Survival world before!

Existing Seed
Plentiful Resources will give you plenty of resources, and will massively accelerate your early and late-game progression. This is a good starting point for patient, beginner players.
Scarce Resources will give you a slower, more thoughtful game, with plenty of time to explore and optimise your base. Not recommended for beginner players!
Greg-level Resources will massively reduce your rate of progression. This is balanced for 24/7 dedicated multiplayer servers or VERY patient people!
Rapid Resources is designed for those in a hurry, with children, jobs, or attempting to stream the game in a weekend! This is also an excellent place if you're looking to learn the game quickly before returning on a harder difficulty.
Slow Conveyors are well-balanced, and emphasise higher-tier conveyance system. This setting will make your progression greatly slower.
Fast Conveyors mean less waiting around. They're about twice as fast as Slow.
Plentiful Power gives greatly improved energy collection from all power generators. This will greatly affect the speed of early-game progress.
Scarce Power gives a balanced power generation. This will slow down early-game progression.
Eternal Day means that your Solar collection systems will work constantly and you do not suffer from a temperature drop at night. Choosing this will allow much faster progression - average Solar Collection is 4x faster!
Normal Day/Night cycle is 24 minutes. For the 12 minutes of darkness you will suffer from extreme temperature drops, increased mob aggression and reduced visibility.
Eternal Night means no respite from the freezing cold during the day, and no access to non-organic solar technology; including your CPH. This will prove to be a significant challenge.
This is the default mode. There is no penalty for death, barring low health and a long walk. This makes the game extremely easy, as there's no penalty for any of the exciting ways in which you can die.
Clumsy mode is recommended if you want a reasonable challenge, and a good reason for not dying! You will drop the contents of your inventory on death!
NOT FOR BEGINNERS!
Iron Man is only for the brave, the stupid and the bold; you permanently LOSE your entire inventory on death!
NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE!
 SquishCore is simple; you die, you stay dead
NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE!
 Hardcore is the hardest mode; If you die, or your CPH dies, it's permanent game over! Your CPH also does not heal.
The Care Package will be unlocked once you have successfully built a Climate Control Centre.
Care Package disabled.
Care Package Enabled! This will give you a massive headstart into a new world, giving you a MK3 build gun, larger suit battery, solar panel and a suit heater right at the start. Go get 'em boy.
Flat Land mode will be unlocked once you have successfully killed a CryoPlasm Spawner.
Flat Mode disabled.
Flat Land Enabled! Makes the land flat, hence the name!
Requires the Frozen Factory Expansion Pack.
Rush Mode will be unlocked once you have successfully charged an Orbital Energy Transmitter.
Rush Mode disabled.
Rush Mode Enabled! This mode challenges you to rebuild another Orbital Energy Transmitter and fully charge it in the minimum amount of time! Selecting this mode will scale up the Power Generation by around 10x and Ore Collection and Smelting are 5x faster. Mobs also spawn much faster too...
Trivial Mobs is not recommended. Mobs still exist to allow full progression, but will pose no challenge, and this is opting out of a large part of the gameplay. You will get reduced Base Threat and reduced spawn rates on Hiveminds and other base-interfering mobs
Normal Mobs - this is where it's at. Good choice!
Hard Mobs - choose this and you will be dealing with much harder, more aggressive mobs. This is ONLY for VERY experienced players!

Press (F) to activate the Grappling Hook
A spread out infrastructure is always better than a compact one
Craft a Threat Scanner early, you never know when you might need to build up your defenses
The higher the threat, the more enemies are likely to attack
Power generation, ore extraction and smelting bars all add to your threat generation
Press (T) on an Ore Extractor to disable notifications from that Ore Extractor
Cargo lifts are superior for vertical transport
Use CTRL to craft 25 items per click
Split your stacks of items by holding the SHIFT key when dragging.
Ores only stack to 150, make sure you smelt these in a smelter before you collect more
Use Power Chargers to quickly regain energy when exploring
Rooms keep you warm on the surface, and also help the game render faster.
Macerators can destruct anything.
Mass storage is superior to storage hoppers for long-term storage and automated crafting.
Enrich coal to increase the efficiency of Pyrothermic Generators
Mynocks will appear on undefended conveyors and eat your hard-earned goods
The Laboratory consumes Experimental Pods to research new items
Place a Hopper next to a machine to feed it with raw materials
Machines will work below their desired Power Per Second (PPS) requirement, but not as fast
Feed Cargo Lifts Controllers with Rack Rails to enable it to go further down
Cargo Lift Controller requires a crafted Cargo Lift and power to start transporting items
Press (E) on Turrets to see their covered area
Crystal deposits require Cutter Heads to extract Ore.
Enter /detail bloom in chat to reduce the light reflection on machines.
Automate early, automate everything!
The world is virtually infinite, make things easier on yourself, and spread out.
Mass storage makes Assembly Line construction easy.
Lifts are cheap and faster than climbing stairs, and anything is safer than Grappling!
A well armed spiderbot can guard against even a sizable onslaught
FALCORs are great to collect Bug Parts  after an attack.
When conveyors aren't enough... Minecarts!
Basic smelters will speed you along with early production when the starting smelter is no longer enough
Arther's power level is displayed just above the hotbar
Total Fortress Power and time of day are represented in the bar below the hotbar
Sloped conveyors are faster (and prettier) than normal Conveyors
When in doubt, press (H).
Automate production to save time and space.
Press (G) to throw a Glowstick.
Look for crystals in underground caves. Upgrading the Crystal Scanner will make finding them much easier.
When you step on a lift that could move up or down, the direction you're facing determines which way it starts moving - look up to go up!
Don't be afraid to rebuild something if your first design doesn't meet your needs anymore.
Open your suit upgrades inventory by pressing (S) in the inventory screen. You can move suit and ARTHER upgrades here to save space in your main inventory.
Many single input machines can function without hoppers if you put conveyer belts on both sides.
Power generation creates threat. Your lab will require enough power to start drawing attention, so start building turrets!
Basic smelters are key to increasing your production before you reach higher tiered metals.
You can turn lots of things into Construction Paste - not just Garbage. Feed your Construction Paste Grinder Coal if you run out!
The alternate mode of the Laboratory can analyse research parts for Research Points.
Conveyors with alien plants on them are feeding a Hive. Defend your belts!
Logistics FALCORs are perfect for low-volume delivery. Various grades of coal to PTGs is a perfect synergy.
Snow makes you walk slowly, reinforced blocks allow you to run faster.
Done it all and looking for more? Check out user created mods on the Steam Workshop!
Don't forget to upgrade ARTHER!
Forced induction speeds up ore smelting!
Pyrothermic Generators are less efficent the deeper they go.
Don't hug the overminds.
Camobots can attack many types of powered machine. Keep an eye and an ear out.
Press (S) while in your inventory to bring up suit upgrades
Torches make heat - use this to stave off Hypothermia.
Alien Worms burrow into Soft Resin.
When did you last tell your mum you love her? You probably should call her.
Tubes work better in the Cold Cavern - belts will freeze
Plasma Cutter Head improves Efficiency of Ore Extractors to 100%
Hiveminds can be fed on purpose!
To drop things from your inventory, hover over them and press (Q)!
Shift-drag items in your inventory to split stacks!
As your base expands, it will draw attention. It's never too early to defend.

This example shows a simple manufacturing station for tin goods. Tin bars are supplied and tin plates and lightweight machine housings are shipped out.
Target inventory is set to 200 for tin bars to have carts bring enough to the station to keep plenty on hand for crafting into higher tier components.
Tin plates are stocked at a lesser quantity as some are needed available to convert to housings.
Lightweight machine housings target of 0 allows carts to take all of them for distribution to other stations as none are required on hand for further processing.

Surplus is the sum of the excess items in storage above the stations' target inventory.  It indicates how much is available for carts to collect for delivery.
Deficit is the sum required to safisfy all stations' inventory targets.  It indicates how much must be delivered to satisfy all stations.
Inventory is the sum of the item that is found across all storage containers that is associated with this freight network.
In transit quantity is the sum of the item that carts are currently carrying for delivery. Carts never collect more than is required to satisfy the deficit.
This example shows healthy status for a particular item on the freight network.
The deficit implies the item is needed but a healthy surplus will more than cover for the total demand.
Current quantity in transit shows that several carts are at work to meet the demand.
Surplus and deficit are color coded to provide the relative health of the system at a glance.
A low surplus may lead to a hold in deliveries due to a supply shortage as the deficit (demand) exceeds available plates.
The inventory is fairly healthy so it may be possible to decrese the supply storage's target inventory to inject extra in an emergency.
If the surplus remains low it may be time to increase production.
None
Stations appear to both offer and request goods on this network but no goods are in transit.  Why might this be?
Carts must be assigned to stations for depots to send carts to work.  Carts in the depots must also satisfy any filter for the cart assignment.
Depots will indicate what is required to send another cart or whether station needs are all satisfied.
If carts are assigned they will indicate with a red flashing light if they cannot find a path to their target.
Carts will only collect as much as the current deficit to avoid having excess that is not needed.
This can slow transfer of items between stations as additional carts will not be able to collect any more items.
Increasing a station's target inventory will increase the deficit and the maximum number of items that can be transferred at once.
A larger target inventory at the destination also provides a bigger buffer to allow time for carts to make further deliveries.
